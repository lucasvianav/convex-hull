# SCC0223 - Data Structures I
## Fist Project - Convex Hull

Repository for the first avaliative project for Data Structures I course offered for applied mathematics undergraduates at ICMC - USP, by professor Elaine Parros Machado de Sousa.

This repository contains an implementation of the Monotone Chain algorithm (Andrew's Algorithm) for calculating the convex hull of a group of points in a cartesian coordinate system. It utilizes lists and stacks and also the concept of Abstract Data Types.
